HIGH priority
* Create an expand module for git
* rewrite color_swatch to do layout dynamically. I'd like to have it show all
  valid combinations for a particular terminal.

MEDIUM priority
* Get the shared code in comify and a in one place.

LOW priority
* Should wclive be able to live-track multiple files?
* I need to build options into the bash function 'a' to allow you to override
  its choice of color.
* Get prompts colored across all machines.

Completion
* Break completion out into its own repository.
* What about adding support for the directories you've visited... Could be done
  by having the prompt_command stash it somewhere.
* What if someone - out of habit - starts typing to resolve the ambiguity?  What
  would happen if I put their keystroke(s) into the completion and returned
  them to the prompt?
* Insert a space at the end of successful completions.
* Columnize output.
* Three columns for expand_scm: file, changelist#, action.
* Why does the options selection list get printed again when you hit ^C?
* make the "option : description" printing order configurable so changelist
  id can come before filespec.
* I would really like to be able to match on the name of the file, so /a/b/cd
  should be matchable with c[Alt-O]
  * What do I do if I have:
    apphosting/...../app_id
    apphosting/...../app_id
    ...and someone has entered app[Alt-O]?
* There needs to be a commandline option to prevent prompting.  Sometimes, I
  want old-fashioned disambiguation.
* Color changelist IDs so they're easier to visually group?
